# Earthquake-Locator
Earthquake Locator is a realtime earthquake location visualizer. We are using USGS's geoJSON API, which is updated every 5 minutes. You can browse earthquake history around the globe based on the magnitude or the time of occurrence.
This application is hosted at jasony0206.github.io/earthquake-locator. This project is still under development.
